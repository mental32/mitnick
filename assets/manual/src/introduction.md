# Introduction

Welcome to _The Mitnick Operators Manual_, The manual aims to be a helpfully
exhaustive guide on how to be an effective operator on a mitnick network.

## What is a _"Mitnick network"_

A "Mitnick network" is technically a virtual network of some amount of hosts,
typically 25 thousand or so, geographically superimposed over the real world.

Specifically it's just an instance of [this software](https://github.com/mental32/mitnick)
running and exposed at some address so that users (operators) can connect to it.

## What are _"Mitnick operators"_

"Mitnick operators" are users that are active on the network. They connect to
the network through some access point (AP) over some protocol (TELNET, SSH) and
play the game as it were.
